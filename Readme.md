This minimal example demonstrates connecting to a server from multiple Jupyter notebooks to interact with a simulation environment. 

Run the server with `python server.py`. Then, use the provided Jupyter notebooks (`notebook_client_1.ipynb` and `notebook_client_2.ipynb`) to connect to the server and independently modify the simulation's state, such as changing the color of agents.
